The primary objective of this project is to develop an efficient and accurate system for classifying ECG images into four categories: myocardial infarction, history of myocardial infarction, abnormal heartbeat, and normal heart conditions. The project aims to leverage state-of-the-art deep learning models—CNN, MobileNet, DenseNet, and a hybrid MobileNet + LSTM approach—to analyze spatial and temporal features of ECG signals.
Through a comparative analysis of these algorithms, the project seeks to identify the best-performing model for real-world applications, based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, the project strives to address challenges in automated ECG classification, such as data variability and complex waveform patterns. Ultimately, the objective is to create a reliable, scalable, and clinically relevant diagnostic tool to enhance early detection and management of cardiac conditions, improving patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency.
